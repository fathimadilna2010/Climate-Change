            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Climate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. It may be a change in average weather conditions, or in the distribution of events around that average (e.g., more or fewer extreme weather events). The Earth's climate has been changing throughout history. Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 7,000 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era — and of human civilization.</p>

            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>The main driver of today's warming is the combustion of fossil fuels. These hydrocarbons heat up the planet via the greenhouse effect, which is caused by the interaction between Earth's atmosphere and incoming radiation from the sun. Fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas release carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases when burned, which enhances this effect.</p>
            <p>Deforestation is another significant contributor to climate change. Trees absorb carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, during photosynthesis. When forests are cut down, not only does this carbon absorption cease, but the stored carbon is also released into the atmosphere as CO2.</p>
            <p>Industrial processes and agricultural practices also contribute to the buildup of greenhouse gases. Industries such as cement production emit large amounts of CO2, while agriculture contributes methane, a potent greenhouse gas, through livestock farming and rice paddies.</p>

        <section id="effects">
            <h2>Effects</h2>
            <p>Climate change affects natural and human systems across the globe. It leads to more frequent and intense extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and droughts that can devastate communities and economies.</p>
            <p>Rising global temperatures also contribute to the melting of ice caps and glaciers, resulting in rising sea levels that threaten coastal areas and islands with increased flooding and erosion.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, changes in climate patterns have significant impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, leading to shifts in species distributions and increased risk of extinction for many vulnerable species.</p>

        <section id="solutions">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p>To combat climate change, it is crucial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This can be achieved by transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power and improving energy efficiency in buildings, vehicles, and industries.</p>
            <p>Adapting to climate change is also necessary. This involves protecting and restoring ecosystems, improving water resources management, and designing cities to cope with extreme weather events.</p>
            <p>International cooperation is essential for addressing climate change effectively. Agreements like the Paris Agreement play a crucial role in setting global targets for reducing emissions and supporting adaptation efforts in developing countries.</p>
